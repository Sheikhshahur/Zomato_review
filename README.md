# NLP Zomato Review Template

## Overview

The NLP Zomato Review Template is a natural language processing (NLP) project designed to analyze and extract insights from customer reviews on the Zomato platform. Zomato is a popular restaurant discovery and food delivery platform, and customer reviews play a crucial role in shaping the overall dining experience.

This project focuses on processing and understanding the sentiment, key themes, and sentiments expressed in the reviews provided by Zomato users. The goal is to leverage NLP techniques to gain valuable insights into customer preferences, sentiments, and common themes mentioned in the reviews.

## Key Features

- Theme Extraction: Identify and extract key themes or topics discussed in the reviews, such as food quality, service, ambiance, etc.
- Insights Generation: Provide actionable insights for restaurants based on the analysis of customer feedback.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Collect customer reviews data from Zomato or use a pre-existing dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Model Training:** Train a natural language processing model to perform sentiment analysis and theme extraction.
4. **Analysis:** Apply the trained model to analyze Zomato reviews and extract valuable insights.
5. **Results Presentation:** Showcase the results through visualizations, summaries, or any relevant output format.

## Usage
